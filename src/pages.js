They would tell me that it wasn't a real sport and tease me for it. But I had always loved it, watching my favorite teams duke it out in esports tournaments around the world. Listening to my favorite shoutcasters creating hype and memorable experiences. I always wanted to be a part of it. So here I am now, trying to make that a reality.</q>",

I wanted to take part in the local esports scene, and I absolutely LOVED hearing the shoutcasters create hype - which is something that I thought I would be capable of. So when I saw on ad on reddit asking for a shoutcaster for an upcoming CS:GO tournament I jumped on it. I sent in a clip of me shoutcasting a replay of one of my matches, and they worked with me to get me on the stage in front of a mic and camera for the very first time! I continued shoutcasting with them until I moved away for university, but I still have a very large space in my heart for the esports arena.",

This was the first time that I had realized that I could provide something as more than just an up-and-comer, something as more than just a new shoutcaster. The Space Productions crew continues to provide me with incredible support, feedback, and advice - and I could not have been happier than to have met them and gotten to know them through this program. I am also extremely grateful to have had MSI sponsor the event, and make sure that every member of the student broadcast initiative was paid hourly for their work; something that is extremely rare in the collegiate esports space.",

With insight into tournament operations, league operations, and global events management - as well as the technical direction involved in such a large scale production - it was an incredible learning opportunity.

Through the pandemic, everything was remote work, and I was able to offer my in-home production studio to create content for UH Esports, creating promotional content, streams, in house tournaments, and more. I continue to grow UH esports as if it were my own program, and in Summer of 2021, we began working directly with the Overwatch League to put on the official Overwatch league 2021 production from our UH esports program here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus."
